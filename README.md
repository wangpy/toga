## Instruction
 1. Install **toga**: from maiden type: `;install https://github.com/wangpy/toga` 
 2. Edit script you want to use **toga** with (similar to [how to edit script to add midigrid support](https://norns.community/en/authors/jaggednz/midigrid#how-to-edit-a-script))
	1. Find occurence of "grid.connect()" in the script code and insert the following line above:
		```
		local grid = util.file_exists(_path.code.."toga") and include "toga/lib/togagrid" or grid
		```
		 - If the script is already edited to support **midigrid**, you can add the support on midigrid library script file: add the line above to line 1 in **code/midigrid/lib/midigrid.lua**. When no midigrid-supported device is connected, toga grid will be initialized.
	2. Find occurence of "grid.connect()"  in the script code and insert the following line above:
		```
		local arc = util.file_exists(_path.code.."toga") and include "toga/lib/togaarc" or arc
		```
	3. Select the edited script on norns to load
 3. Download **toga.tosc** controller file and import to TouchOSC (new version, not working with Mk1).
 4. Set up connections to norns:
	1. Choose UDP
	2. Look up norns IP address in **SYSTEM** -> **WIFI** and input to **Host** field
	3. Input 10111 to **Send Port**
	4. Input 8002 to **Receive Port** (any unused port number should work)
5. Run the TouchOSC controller (by clicking Play button).
6. Tap the upper-right green button to connect to norns. The green button should light up and the controller should be running.
7. (Optional) Adding default TouchOSC client address:
	1. Open **code/toga/lib/togagrid.lua** file
	2. Find the line `-- UNCOMMENT to add default touchosc client`
	3. Remove leading `--` in the line below, and edit the IP address in the line.
	4. Open **code/toga/lib/togaarc.lua** file and repeat the step 2 and 3.
	5. Reload the script on norns. Now **toga** will automatically connect to the TouchOSC controller when the script is loaded.

## Orientation

The orientation button says which round the grid should be oriented.
Any change here only updates after clicking the connection button,
so if you set or change the orientation on the grid, touch the connection
button to register that.
